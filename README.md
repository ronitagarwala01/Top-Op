# Topology Optimizer
This repository contains a Topolgy Optimizer written in Python with the help of the Finite Element library Fenics, an iterative U-NET architecture aimed at speeding up the problem of mass minimization with stress and compliance constraints, a DCGAN, and a Genetic Algorithm approach. Sponsor - Dr. Rinderspacher(ARL).
